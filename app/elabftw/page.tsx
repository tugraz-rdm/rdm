          eLabFTW is an electronic solution to the classic lab notebook and
          offers many additional practical features (scheduler, collaborative
          working, lab equipment management, etc.). It is an open source
          solution that is already in use at many research institutions
          worldwide. TU Graz runs its own instance of eLabFTW and it is
          available to all members of TU Graz. Since you interact with the
          software primarily via the browser, you do not need any additional
          software.
