        Data management processes are handled heterogeneously by researchers,
        which can result in problems with data handling during collaboration, or
        lead to issues when reusing research output in the future (be it days or
        several years). Strategies for data management have to consider
        technical, organisational, legal, structural, and sustainability aspects
        into account.

          Proper RDM enables you and your team to find research objects, even
          after years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper descriptions and sufficient metadata ensure you and others can
          understand and reuse older data and datasets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid waste of resources and unnecessary redundancies through
          optimized workflows.
