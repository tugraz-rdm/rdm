        Data management processes are often heterogeneously handled among
        researchers resulting in possible data handling issues during
        collaboration or after several years when it comes to reusing older
        research output. Data management strategies take technical,
        organizational, legal, structural, and sustainable aspects into account.

          Proper RDM enables you and your team to be able to find research
          objects, even after years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper descriptions and sufficient meta data ensure that you and
          others can understand and reuse older data (sets).

        <li>
          Avoid waste of resources and unnecessary redundancies through
          optimized workflows.

        <li>
          This will save time and effort otherwise lost in actions of searching
