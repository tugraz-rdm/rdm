# RDM - Services

## Overview

The goal of our project is to create an efficient, scalable, and flexible service platform. To accomplish this, we've chosen a technology stack that leverages the latest in web development frameworks and platforms.

## Technology Stack

### Full-Stack Web 

**Next.js & React**: We've chosen Next.js as our frontend framework. It's built on top of React, which allows for a component-based approach to building user interfaces. Next.js supports both server-side rendering and static site generation, offering an excellent balance between performance and SEO. Utilizing React's framework within Next.js will aid us in creating a scalable and maintainable web application.

**Tailwind CSS**: For styling, we could be using Tailwind CSS. It provides pre-defined CSS classes that make it quick and easy to style our application without having to write custom CSS.

**Node.js**: Based on the complexity of the web application, we may integrate additional backend frameworks or platforms as necessary.

### Deployment

**Vercel**: We've selected Vercel for deployment due to its one-click deployment process and excellent support for Next.js applications.

## Upcoming Improvements

I'm also excited to share that Next.js 13 is expected to release soon with several significant improvements:

- **Automatic Image Optimization**: This feature will automatically optimize and compress images, improving page performance and reducing bandwidth usage.
- **Improved Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: ISR allows for partial updates of static pages without rebuilding the entire site, and Next.js 13 is set to enhance this feature.
- **Better Web Vitals Tracking**: Next.js 13 aims to provide better tracking and reporting of Web Vitals, helping developers optimize their sites.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Faster build times, better error handling, and improved debugging tools are some of the improvements to the developer experience that are expected.
- **Built-in Middleware**: Next.js 13 will introduce built-in middleware support, allowing developers to add custom middleware without using an external library.
