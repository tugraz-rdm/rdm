      "description": "TU Graz DMP Tool is based on an open source solution called DAMAP that serves as a tool for machine actionable DMPs (maDMPs). DAMAP was developed in collaboration with TU Wien and is under continuous improvement. DAMAP was adapted to the institutional requirements of TU Graz (e.g. design, integration of existing databases) and is available to all TU Graz members for the creation of their data management plans. TU Graz DMP Tool is availbale under the following link. We are also looking for volunteers who would like to test the new tool and give us feedback on improvements or similar. In the following video you can get a quick overview of DAMAP:",
